1. - let is used to declare a variable which can be reassigned but not redeclared and it is function or block scoped.
   - var is used to declare a variable which can be reassigned, redeclared and it is globally scoped.
   - const is used to declare a variable which cannot be reassigned and it is block or function scoped.

2. Java script objects are a list of value-key pairs. They are different from arrays in that objects are mutable while arrays are not.

3. - == is used to show strict equality, in that when comparing a variable with a value or another variable, they are first converted to the same data type before comparision.
   - === is used to show loosely strict equality, in that when comparing a variable with a value or another variable, both the data type and value are compared.

4. An event is the occurance of a variable or element.

5. - forEach applies a function to all elements in an array. While the map method accesses a particular function inthe array using its index value.
   - Both methods are used to dictate which elements of an array should be manipulated using the given function.
